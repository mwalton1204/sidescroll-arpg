Player -> Ability

- Implement find_ability(ability_name: String) -> Ability in Player.gd.
- Deduct mana via modify_mana(-mana_cost) when abilities activate.
- Connect Ability signals (ability_unlocked, ability_upgraded, ability_failed_to_unlock, ability_failed_to_upgrade, ability_used) to Player.gd or UI handlers.
- Update Player.gd to call process_ability(delta, self) on all abilities each frame.
- Add type hints to all Player.gd, Ability.gd, and AbilityRequirement.gd methods and exported variables.
- Add signals for stat and job changes in Player.gd (stat_modified, job_changed) for UI or system integration.
- Validate AbilityRequirement lookups and emit warnings if a referenced stat, ability, or item does not exist.
- Consider refactoring inventory into a dedicated Inventory class/component for easier management.
- Ensure passive abilities in Ability.gd donâ€™t incorrectly decrement cooldown timers.
- Optionally switch Player abilities storage to dictionary-based for faster lookups if large numbers of abilities are expected.
